## Explanation

This app shows the currency list and currency detail page. The application has 2 screens, these are: home page and detail page.
Home page
Table view is used on the home page, where all cryptocurrencies and items received from the web service are listed in list format.
The user can view all currencies in a tabular view with their icons, change and exchange price and the price of the crypto itself.
The user can apply filters such as: price, market cap, 24-hour volume, change, date. With these filters, you can sort cryptocurrencies by selecting them from the menu view.

  
## Lessons Learned

Although I knew the mvvm logic well in this project and I thought I implemented it very well, I would like to point out that I could not make the graphical interface, which is an extra point, well enough and I could not apply the MVVM architecture (only in the graphics part).
